            <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
            <p>
                In urban areas of the <b>Global South</b>, transportation has become increasingly essential for <b>women</b>. Yet, navigating these routes is fraught with challenges. 
                From the <b>rising costs of ride-hailing apps</b> like Uber due to inflation to the <b>threats of harassment on buses and rickshaws</b>, safe and affordable options are limited.
                In regions like Pakistan, the situation is compounded by <b>poor road conditions, inadequate street lighting, and high crime rates</b>. 
                As a result, many women are trapped in a cycle of fear, unable to confidently commute to their destinations.

            <p> My literature review focused on the gender disparities in urban mobility in developing nations. 
                In this review, I identified the main challenges women encounter both inside and outside vehicles while traveling.

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Travel Patterns:</b> Women have unique travel patterns, making more trips and relying more on public transport than men. Despite this, transport infrastructures don’t cater to their specific needs, with societal attitudes further limiting their mobility. </li>
                        <li><b>Smart Mobility:</b> Smart mobility apps were meant to aid disadvantaged groups like women but often sideline their needs, resulting in safety concerns. Limited tech literacy or phone access greatly hinders women’s use of these apps.</li>
                        <li><b>Social Attitudes:</b> Societal norms, such as the expectation for married women not to travel without their husbands, are just one of many barriers limiting women’s mobility. Deep-rooted beliefs about honor further restrict their independence and opportunities.</li>

                        <li><b>Outside Vehicles:</b> Women grapple with long, unpredictable wait times at bus stops, inadequate lighting on routes to these stops, the necessity to traverse longer distances due to limited routes, and frequent encounters with harassment while waiting.</li>
                        <li><b>Public Transport:</b> The tightly-packed public transport often exposes them to harassment, with unwanted contact, lewd gestures, and catcalls from men. These experiences deter women from public transport, affecting their educational and career decisions as they prioritize safety.</li>
                        <li><b>Personal Vehicles:</b> Male drivers often show less respect to female drivers on the road. Additionally, traffic inspectors and mechanics may attempt to overcharge women, capitalizing on perceived vulnerabilities. </li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Undergraduate students who would commute daily. We also included male participants in our study for a comparative analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Study Design:</strong>  Our mixed-methods approach included a quantitative survey (with 84 respondents) to collect <b>statistical travel data</b> from our audience. 
                    This was followed by semi-structured interviews with 11 participants (3 M, 8 F) to gain deeper insights into the <b>pain points, needs, and desires</b> of our audience regarding commute options.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Study Questions</h3>
            <p>&#128269 These questions encompass the primary objectives of our study:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>What factors <b>influence women’s</b> decisions when selecting a mode of transportation for their daily commute?</li>
                <li>In what ways do existing transportation options <b>fail</b> to meet the specific needs of female commuters?</li>
                <li>What types of <b>support systems</b> are female commuters seeking within the transport infrastructure to feel safe?</li>
                <li>How do the commuting patterns of female commuters <b>differ</b> from those of their male counterparts?</li>

            </figure>

            <p>We can see from our data that women are disproportionately affected by harassment during their travels, with 16% of female commuters who utilize public transport having faced at least one instance of harassment. </p>
            <p>However, it should be noted that the most commonly faced issues across both genders and all travel modes are related to the affordability of traveling. This helped us understand that one of the most important pain points for our target audience was the <b>rising travel costs</b> due to Pakistan’s worsening economy</p>

                    <p>Enhancing public transport to create a safe and affordable commuting option is crucial for women. They often report harassment at bus stops as a significant issue. To address this, we plan to redesign bus stops with enhanced safety measures:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Continuous surveillance with security cameras at all stops.</li>
                        <li>An emergency button to instantly alert the nearest police station.</li>
                        <li>A lockable door allows individuals to secure themselves at the stop while awaiting assistance.</li>
                        
                    </ul>

                    <p>Additionally, the stops will feature interactive kiosks displaying nearby bus information and routes, where travelers can conveniently book their rides and child-friendly areas for women who are traveling with infants.</p>

                    <p>
    
                        Given the numerous advantages directly aligned with our fundamental design objectives, (<b>safety, reliability, and affordability</b>), we chose to proceed with the data-driven carpooling smartphone application approach. 
        
                    </p>

                    <p>After some brainstorming, we settled on the name <b>Caraamad</b> for our platform, which we hoped would create a welcoming vibe for our platform due to the wordplay.</p>
                    
                    <p>We conducted a quick survey to collect data about the most important features of Caraamad and finalized the features listed in the following image.</p>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

            <p>Our design prioritized <b>safety and reliability</b>. For the theme, we decided to go with pastel hues as our primary tones evoke gentle and soothing feelings. This would make the users comfortable and feel at ease as they interact with the application.</p>

            <p>I designed the screens below to provide instant and effortless access to comprehensive information to the user about their drivers, riders, and every aspect of the journey. This approach would ensure that our users are consistently well-informed, enhancing both their security and experience.</p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            
            <p>The Caraamad project has made significant strides since its inception. Together with <b>Dr. Suleman Shahid</b> from Tilburg University, our team showcased a high-fidelity prototype of Caraamad to the <b>Punjab Safe City Authorities (PSCA)</b>. Pleased with our presentation, the PSCA integrated our design suggestions into their Women's Safety Application. Furthermore, our initiative garnered financial support from both the <b>Higher Education Commission of Pakistan</b> and the <b>World Bank</b>. Since then, our team has been diligently enhancing the User Experience for the Women's Safety Application. </p>

            <p>Working on this project was the highlight of my junior year at university. It marked my first foray into formal design education. Immersing myself in User Research, I discovered a passion I intend to follow as my life’s work. I also take pride in knowing that this project made a tangible difference in addressing the critical issue of implementing safe and affordable urban mobility for women in Pakistan, and I hope all my future work can have such outcomes.</p>
