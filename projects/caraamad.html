            <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
            <p>
                In urban areas of the <b>Global South</b>, transportation has become increasingly essential for <b>women</b>. Yet, navigating these routes is fraught with challenges. 
                From the <b>rising costs of ride-hailing apps</b> like Uber due to inflation to the <b>threats of harassment on buses and rickshaws</b>, safe and affordable options are limited.
                In regions like Pakistan, the situation is compounded by <b>poor road conditions, inadequate street lighting, and high crime rates</b>. 
                As a result, many women are trapped in a cycle of fear, unable to confidently commute to their destinations.

            <h2>Desk Research</h2>
            <p> My literature review focused on the gender disparities in urban mobility in developing nations. 
                In this review, I identified the main challenges women encounter both inside and outside vehicles while traveling.

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Travel Patterns:</b> Women have unique travel patterns, making more trips and relying more on public transport than men. Despite this, transport infrastructures don’t cater to their specific needs, with societal attitudes further limiting their mobility. </li>
                        <li><b>Smart Mobility:</b> Smart mobility apps were meant to aid disadvantaged groups like women but often sideline their needs, resulting in safety concerns. Limited tech literacy or phone access greatly hinders women’s use of these apps.</li>
                        <li><b>Social Attitudes:</b> Societal norms, such as the expectation for married women not to travel without their husbands, are just one of many barriers limiting women’s mobility. Deep-rooted beliefs about honor further restrict their independence and opportunities.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Outside Vehicles:</b> Women grapple with long, unpredictable wait times at bus stops, inadequate lighting on routes to these stops, the necessity to traverse longer distances due to limited routes, and frequent encounters with harassment while waiting.</li>
                        <li><b>Public Transport:</b> The tightly-packed public transport often exposes them to harassment, with unwanted contact, lewd gestures, and catcalls from men. These experiences deter women from public transport, affecting their educational and career decisions as they prioritize safety.</li>
                        <li><b>Personal Vehicles:</b> Male drivers often show less respect to female drivers on the road. Additionally, traffic inspectors and mechanics may attempt to overcharge women, capitalizing on perceived vulnerabilities. </li>

            <h2>Prototyping</h2>

            <p>I created the high-fidelity prototype on Figma due to the newly introduced Dev Mode, which would quicken up our workflow.</p>
            <p>The focus of this design was <b>familiarity</b>. I wanted to design a familiar, user-friendly, and intuitive interface for the doctors so that they efficiently answer patient queries with minimal interaction cost.</p>
        
            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>According to color theory, blue symbolizes calm, security, and order. Furthermore, research shows that blue and white is the most popular color scheme in healthcare design, aligning with my goal for a familiar look.</p>
            <p>I selected the <b>Roboto</b> typeface for its screen readability and balance between content density and reading comfort.</p>

            </figure>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>We implemented a security code requirement in the application’s registration flow to protect sensitive patient data, providing an added defense against data theft. This would ensure that only doctors from our team could register for the application.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Due to the doctor’s familiarity with the messaging application, we implemented a <b>WhatsApp-like</b> interface for the collaboration and answer mechanisms. Doctors can listen to the patient’s query, collaborate with others, and record their answers from the same interface. </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>We developed an Android version of this application (with a PHP backend), which was launched on March 6, 2023. To date, the doctors have answered <b>100% of valid questions</b> on the platform. I have included a number of relevant statistics below:</p>

            </figure>
            <p>For future developments of the Super Abbu doctors app, we’re exploring <b>integrating large language models</b> within the interface. This enhancement aims to elevate the quality of doctor responses and expedite their response times. Pertinent research directions for this update would relate to <b>how we can evaluate and negate automation biases</b> that may arise in the doctor’s responses. </p>

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p><b>This project was an amazing experience for me</b> &#10024</p>
            <p>As someone who worked on the design, development, and deployment of this application, I am immensely proud of the impact that it has created. The UX research for this project <b>taught me how to design for populations with limited tech literacy</b>. I am eager to dive deeper into this domain and harness these insights in future endeavors.</p>
            <p>My heartfelt appreciation goes out to Professor Mustafa Naseem and the entire team. Their guidance was indispensable, and their expertise significantly enriched the trajectory of our project.</p> -->
