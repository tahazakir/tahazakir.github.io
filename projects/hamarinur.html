            <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
            <p>Pakistan ranks among the top ten countries most impacted by climate change, with climate disasters affecting <b>33 million people in 2022</b> alone, resulting in significant human and economic losses from floods, droughts, and heat waves. </p>

            <p>This escalating crisis has heightened anxiety among youth; a recent study showed nearly <b>70% of 10,000 participants are deeply concerned</b>. Addressing this crisis is imperative to ensure the well-being of Pakistan‚Äôs citizens, especially the youth, and to pave the way for a sustainable future. Widespread adoption of <b>sustainable behavior</b> can be a key factor in mitigating this crisis.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p> &#10067 <b> Problem: How might we design a solution to encourage sustainable behavior change in Pakistan?  </b> </p>

            <h2>Desk Research</h2>
            <p>My literature review focused on the perceptions and attitudes of our target audience toward the climate crisis. I also explored the effectiveness of various types of Persuasive Technologies in encouraging sustained behavior change.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Emotional Drivers:</b> Negative feelings about climate change motivate action, but sustained change needs positive reinforcement before and after pro-environmental actions.</li>
                        <li><b>Young Adults‚Äô Views:</b> Young adults are more concerned and optimistic about climate action than older adults. Effective engagement means framing the issue as current and relatable, using simplified language.</li>
                        <li><b>Role of Religion:</b> In Muslim-majority societies, Islam can influence climate perceptions. Many see it as human negligence, divine punishment, or an end-times sign. Using faith can promote environmental actions.

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Primarily teenagers and young adults in Pakistan, who will likely face the most significant impacts of the climate crisis in the coming years. I also interviewed some older adults to explore traditional sustainable practices from Pakistan that are fading over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Study Design:</strong> 

                    We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 young adults (7M, 6F) and 2 older adults (1 M, 1F). The duration of these interviews ranged from 30 to 50 minutes each. The interview protocol for this study can be accessed <a href="/assets/HN_Interview Protocol.pdf"> here</a>. 
                    Interviews were conducted in person, and participants were compensated for their time through snacks (tea and cookies).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Study Questions</h3>
            <p>&#128269 These questions encompass the primary objectives of our study:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>How do young adults and elders in Pakistan <b>perceive and understand</b> the climate crisis, and how does it personally affect them?</li>
                <li>How do participants perceive the <b>of different sources of information on the climate crisis</b>, and why do they trust certain sources more than others?</li>
                <li>What <b>individual and household practices</b> are currently in place to address the crisis, and what motivates or hinders these actions?</li>
                <li>How do elders define sustainable living, and what <b>traditional practices</b> did they employ that might be reintroduced or adapted?</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Data Analysis</h3>

            <p>We transcribed each interview verbatim and then translated Urdu phrases into English. We made sure that no meaning was lost in translation. Next, we used ATLAS.ti to conduct a thematic analysis of the data. 
            </p>

            <p>This involved coding the data to identify significant statements and concepts, grouping the codes into categories, and then synthesizing these categories into overarching themes. </p>

                    <h4>Story: </h4>
                    <p>Sara is a sophomore-year student who is majoring in CS. When confronted with news about the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis, she was worried about the planet‚Äôs future. She resolved to live a sustainable lifestyle but found herself making unsustainable choices that were more convenient for her when the initial shock about the climate crisis wore off.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Feels guilty about not taking action to address the crisis, contributing to her anxiety about the future.</li>
                        <li>Trying to form sustainable habits but finds it difficult. Gets distracted by her day-to-day occupations and only remembers about the crisis when confronted with its effects.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Need: </h4>
                    <p>Something that helps her develop environmentally friendly habits to adopt a sustainable lifestyle.</p>

                <section class="ideation-text">

                  <p>For effective brainstorming, we tried a twist on the affinity mapping technique. We divided our design goals into sub-problems and then brainstormed solutions for those sub-problems. Our final design was based on the best combination of ideas from those sub-problems.</p>
                  
                  <p>We focused on three core sub-problems: portability, continual reminders, and relatability.</p>

                  <ul>

                    <li> <b>Portability:</b> Recognizing the ubiquitous nature of smartphones, we chose them as our primary medium, ensuring accessibility for a broad user base.</li>
                    <li> <b>Continual Reminders:</b> Instead of conventional, often intrusive, push notifications, we embraced ambient interfaces. These interfaces offer subtle, immersive cues without overwhelming users.</li>
                    <li> <b>Relatability:</b> Rooting our approach in Pakistan‚Äôs culture and tradition, we crafted a narrative that progresses as users make eco-friendly choices, making the experience deeply contextual and familiar.</li>
                  </ul>

            </div>

            <h3>Crafting the Narrative</h3>
            <p>Our user research shows that visualizations of natural disasters can elicit the strongest emotional response. However, desensitization emerged as a concern, with certain participants becoming indifferent to frequent news of the 2022 flooding in Pakistan. </p>

            <p> Thus, our task was to capture attention without inducing emotional fatigue. We chose the mundane village of Lalewala as our setting, reflecting the rustic essence and charm of Pakistan‚Äôs rural heartland, which we further emphasized using a palette dominated by greens and browns.</p>

            <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

            <p>Our design prioritized <b>safety and reliability</b>. For the theme, we decided to go with pastel hues as our primary tones evoke gentle and soothing feelings. This would make the users comfortable and feel at ease as they interact with the application.</p>

            <p>I designed the screens below to provide instant and effortless access to comprehensive information to the user about their drivers, riders, and every aspect of the journey.

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            
            <p>The Caraamad project has made significant strides since its inception. Together with <b>Dr. Suleman Shahid</b> from Tilburg University, our team showcased a high-fidelity prototype of Caraamad to the <b>Punjab Safe City Authorities (PSCA)</b>. Pleased with our presentation, the PSCA integrated our design suggestions into their Women's Safety Application. Furthermore, our initiative garnered financial support from both the <b>Higher Education Commission of Pakistan</b> and the <b>World Bank</b>. Since then, our team has been diligently enhancing the User Experience for the Women's Safety Application. </p>

            <p>Working on this project was the highlight of my junior year at university. It marked my first foray into formal design education. Immersing myself in User Research, I discovered a passion I intend to follow as my life‚Äôs work. I also take pride in knowing that this project made a tangible difference in addressing the critical issue of implementing safe and affordable urban mobility for women in Pakistan, and I hope all my future work can have such outcomes.</p>
