            <h2>Problem Identification</h2>

            <p> In Pakistan, the issue of low literacy rates is a pressing educational challenge, with recent surveys revealing that a <b>staggering 75% of the population claims not to read any books</b>. Furthermore, even though Urdu is the sole national language of Pakistan, <b>it is only used as a first language by 8% of the country’s population</b>.</p>

            <p>
                These alarming statistics are indicative of a wider problem: a <b>significant disengagement from Urdu literature, particularly among children</b>. Left unchecked, this trend could result in the loss of Pakistan's rich cultural and linguistic identity in future generations.

                My literature review focused on the design of effective language learning technologies and interfaces for children. I also explored insights about designing accessible web content as I aimed to make our platform usable for persons with visual impairments.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Multimedia Engagement:</b> Incorporating images and audio can effectively maintain children’s engagement, as these interactive elements are particularly adept at capturing and holding their attention.

                <li>
                    <b>Color Theory:</b> Warmer colors like Yellow have been recognized as ideal colors to increase learners’ attention and keep them from being bored.

                    <b>Accessibility Guidelines:</b> Important considerations include (but not limited to) the provision of alternate text, clear separation of background and foreground, and maximized compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers.

                    We conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 students from private schools in Pakistan.
                    Interviews were conducted remotely on Zoom under the supervision of the student’s parents or adult siblings.

            <p>
                We decided to develop a <b>digital library and a text-to-speech story reader</b> to scale up audiobook production. This decision was influenced by the digital library’s ability to <b>accommodate multiple modalities</b>, including support for readers with visual impairments, as well as the relative ease of expanding the library's collection at a low cost compared to the other ideas.

                        Based on the insights I gained about color theory in education from my literature review, I selected yellow as the primary color for our design. I used the WebAIM color contrast tool to verify that the colors for the background and all other components on the website were compliant with at least the <b>AA Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)</b>. 
    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While I could not find any specific guidelines for typefaces to enhance student learning, I chose the <b>Rounded Mplus font</b> due to its playful look to appeal to children. 
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        For the paragraphs, I used the default (Medium) style, while headings were set in Bold. I selected the <b>Noto Nastaliq font</b> for Urdu text because of its clarity and readability on digital interfaces.

                The focus of this design was simplicity and organization. We aimed to make our website easily navigable, even for children with limited digital literacy. Furthermore, we made sure that the content on each page is organized in a predictable and appropriate hierarchy to ensure optimal navigation for screen readers.

                Throughout the web development efforts, I organized tutorials for my team and evaluation syncs to ensure that each aspect of the design and development was compatible with <b>WCAG 2.1</b>. These efforts include (but are not limited to) making sure that links are highlighted even in grayscale mode, providing alt-text for images, and ensuring that the keyboard focus order matches the visual layout.

                For the TTS-generated stories, we tested a variety of TTS systems, such as Facebook’s MMS-TTS models and OpenAI’s TTS models. As of the time of writing this case study, our testing revealed that OpenAI’s TTS stories ranked consistently higher than others based on qualitative assessments using <b>mean opinion scores</b>.

                We used <b>React</b> for the front end and <b>Node</b> for the back end due to the team's experience in these technologies. 
            </p>

            <p>
                To enhance the TTS stories, I created an <b>interface that leveraged GPT-4 and few-shot learning to automatically add diacritics to Urdu text (as most Urdu text online does not include diacritics)</b>, which resulted in more natural-sounding audio from the TTS models.

                We carried out usability testing for Kahaani with 6 participants from our target audience. This helped us evaluate the platform and gather insights about additional features that users desire.

                Based on the insights from our usability testing, we are now exploring different ways to incorporate interactivity in Kahaani. To that end, I have been developing a speech-based chatbot that enables users to play through interactive Choose Your Own adventures and aim to submit a poster for that project soon.
